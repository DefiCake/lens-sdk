- other missing modules - see DESIGN.md
- add `__typename` to fragments if needed
- documentation for each method as a comment block with example of use
- export used types - typedoc generation helps to know what is used
- update /examples/node scripts to use v2
- unit tests - maybe not needed and be replaced by e2e tests (cc Juan)
- test scenarios use-case based - maybe client sdk could be used for e2e API tests - cc Juan
